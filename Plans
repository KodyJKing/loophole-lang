- Keep the language simple initially. User's don't need to write applications in it. They just need to be able to solve puzzles.

Program Structure:
    - All code is in a function. 
    - Everything starts in main.

Scoping:
    - There is no block level scoping. There is only global scope and local function scope.
        - There will be no declaration keyword, an assignment will go to whichever scope it's already defined in (global or local),
          or it will go to the local scope. 
    - There are no closures.

Data types: 
    - functions, maps, strings, numbers, booleans
        - member access is only possible on maps

Control:
    - if, while, for(;;)

Security:
    - Don't allow access to object members. Use maps for everything and only allow get/set.
    - Only communicate through external api functions.
    
- Serializability
    - Do not store references to external api functions, use wrappers that refer to the apis by strings.
        - Do NOT use continuations in the wrappers. Everything must still work when the apis are replaced.
