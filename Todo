Parser/Preprocessor
- Move postprocessing of nodes like BinaryOperations or CallExpressionChain to preprocessor.
- Add a preprocess phase to add missing location information.
- Add member expressions to parser. These need to be implemented similar to or as a part of CallExpressionChain.

Interpreter
- Implement if/for.
- Implement break/continue.
  Move up the context chain until the first loop is found and set it's step.
  Refactor Stepper's so they can decide what to do with a request to break/continue.
